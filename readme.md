## Mercury NaD2 Exosphere Spectral Observation Data Reduction Pipeline

We present a data product consisting of ground-based observations of Mercury's sodium exosphere. We have amassed a sizeable dataset of several thousand spectral observations of Mercury's exosphere from the McMath-Pierce solar telescope. Over the last year, a data reduction pipeline has been developed and refined to process and reconstruct these spectral images into low resolution images of sodium D2 emission. This dataset, which extends over two decades, will provide an unprecedented opportunity to analyze the dynamics of Mercury's mid to high-latitude exospheric emissions, which have long been attributed to solar wind ion bombardment. This large archive of observations will be of great use to the Mercury science community in studying the effects of space weather on Mercury's tenuous exosphere. When completely processed, images in this dataset will show the observed spatial distribution of Na D2 in the Mercurian exosphere, have measurements of this sodium emission per pixel in units of kilorayleighs, and be available through NASA's Planetary Data System. The overall goal of the presentation will be to provide the Planetary Science community with a clear picture of what information and data this archival product will make available.
