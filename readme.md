For a few years now I have actively and inactively been developing the data reduction pipeline for these images. Project is due for completion in July 2018. However, I only recently initiated this repo for purposes of collaboration with a collegue at CU Boulder's LASP. If the project recieves an extension beyond July 2018, I'll continue to process the raw data and continue building the cache of data product intended for submission to NASA's Planetary Database System (Mercury Node).
